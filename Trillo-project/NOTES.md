* CSS variables could be manipulated with javascript and could be used instead of preprocessor variables

* Prefer to use SVG over icon fonts, icon fonts usually fails on some browsers.

* to format an SVG icon, we need to set its height and width.

* Usually the side bar is a `ul` html element.

* When using SVGs in HTML, Prefer to use a sprite svg file, because it saves unnecessary http calls.
