## How CSS Works? (Behind The Scene):

  #### Three Golden Rules When Building HTML & CSS:

  1. Responsive Design: Websites should work responsively to any device they work on, topics like fluid layouts, media queries, responsive images, correct units, and desktop-first vs mobile-first approaches are crucial.

  2. Maintainable and scalable code: topics like how to organize files, how to name html classes, and even how to structure HTML tags.

  3. Web Performance: less size, and fast app. Somethings to consider are less HTTP requests, Less Code, Compress Code, use CSS preprocessor (like SaSS), **less images**, and compress images.

  #### What Actually Happens?

  ##### Overview

  * The step `Process final CSS Values` is when units like `%` gets converted to `px`.
  * the visual formatting model uses the `box-model`, `floats` and `positioning` to render the CSS.
